1. difference between EOF & 'EOF'
    a. either way '' get removed
    b. with '' and "" the text doesn't get expanded >> no dynamic content
2. leading whitespace before delimiter doesn't count
    cat << EOF works the same as
    cat <<EOF
    cat <<      EOF

from GNU Bash:

No parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or filename expansion is performed on word. 
If any part of word is quoted, 
    > the delimiter is the result of quote removal on word, 
    > and the lines in the here-document are not expanded. 
If word is unquoted, all lines of the here-document are subjected 
- to parameter expansion,
- command substitution, and 
- arithmetic expansion, 
the character sequence \newline is ignored, and ‘\’ must be used to quote the characters ‘\’, ‘$’, and ‘`’. 

some tests:
- cat <<EOF > out | grep "this" > check
