so we have some rules regarding expansion:
1. If the $ sign is followed by a word:
     1. if the $VAR is in the env list, print the value stored in the variable.
     2.if it isn't, take it as a string
2. if it isn't followed by anything, just print the $ sign literally

//lexer_tokens -> expanded_lexer_tokens
/*
$ = $
$? = exit code
$VAR = the value in the var
$NO_EXIST = empty
$'string' = string
$'$hello' = echo the string '$hello'
$"$TRUE_VAR" = var

*/

//step 1: identify $'' and extract '', leave the quotes, remove $
//step 2: identify $ and expand
//example: $'$'$'$'$
//while going over string
    //single quotes: remove quotes, leave dollar
    //double quotes: remove quotes, expand dollar
