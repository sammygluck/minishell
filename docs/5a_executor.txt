Steps executor (very high level)
1. confirm the return from the parser
2. count the number of commands?? 
-> the commands are handled by different functions so a distinction needs to made between regular commands 
and builtins
-> if successful; the executor will execute all commands seperated by the pipes


Questions
2. minishell loop?

start: int executor

*redirections:
- loop through cmd nodes and check for redirections
	> count the number of (input/output) redirections?? 

*multiple commands
- while loop that loops through the different cmds in the t_cmd struct
- if struct t_cmd *next != 0 >> this means that there is/are pipes 
	-> init pipe 
	-> fork to create child processes

Some tests:
- echo "hallo" > hallo | cat -e
--> no output on terminal
- ls | > output
--> output file should be created but nothing written in file


concerns:
- the opened fd's > are they all properly closed once command line input is executed?
