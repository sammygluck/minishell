1. Handle quotes
    function to check if it's a quote
    
Thoughts:
Until now I thought that finding a quote is necessary in the
beginning of the word
As a result, I made finding a quote a seperate token

But, what if you have a quote within a word?
This question made me reevaluate the parsing of the lexer quote function.

It's clear that quotes play a role both in the lexing stage and in the expanding stage.
In the lexing stage: we can't chop up words if they're stuck together by quotes.
In the expanding stage: we have to ignore the $ sign in cases of single quotes.

Hence, cleaning the quotes, will probably only happen in the expanding stage.
