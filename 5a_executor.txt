Steps executor (very high level
1. confirm the return from the parser
2. count the number of commands
-> the commands are handled by different functions so a distinction needs to made between regular commands 
and builtins
-> if successful; the executor will execute all commands seperated by the pipes


Questions
2. minishell loop?

start: int executor

*redirections:
- loop through cmd nodes and check for redirections
	> count the number of (input/output) redirections

- if struct t_cmd *next != 0 >> this means that there is/are pipes 
	-> init pipe 
	-> fork to create child processes
- close the write end of the pipe

Some issues:
1. the redirection output is not the same as in bash (use diff command to check for differences)
2.
