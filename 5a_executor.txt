Steps executor (very high level
1. confirm the return from the parser
2. count the number of commands
-> the commands are handled by different functions so a distinction needs to made between regular commands 
and builtins
-> if successful; the executor will execute all commands seperated by the pipes


Questions
2. minishell loop?

start: int executor(t_cmd *cmds)

- while loop that loops through the different cmds in the t_cmd struct
- if struct t_cmd *next != 0 >> this means that there is/are pipes 
	-> init pipe 
	-> fork to create child processes
- close the write end of the pipe
