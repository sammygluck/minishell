so we have some rules regarding expansion:
1. If the $ sign is followed by a word:
     1. if the $VAR is in the env list, print the value stored in the variable.
     2.if it isn't, take it as a string
2. if it isn't followed by anything, just print the $ sign literally

Am I missing some rules?

Your outlined rules cover some fundamental cases of the `$` expansion behavior. However, there are more intricacies to consider when working with shells, especially something feature-rich like `bash`. Here's an expanded set of rules:

1. **Variable Expansion**:
   - If the `$` sign is followed by a word (sequence of alphanumeric characters or underscores, beginning with an alphabetical character or underscore):
     1. If `VAR` exists in the environment list or as a shell variable, replace `$VAR` with its value.
     2. If it doesn't exist, replace `$VAR` with an empty string (unless the shell is set to treat undefined variables as an error).
  
2. **Literal `$`**:
   - If the `$` is followed by a character that doesn't start a valid variable name, treat the `$` literally.

3. **Special Variables**:
   - `$?` gives the exit status of the last command.
   - `$#` gives the number of positional parameters.
   - `$$` provides the process ID of the shell.
   - `$0`, `$1`, ... give the script name and positional parameters, respectively.
   ... and so on.

4. **Command Substitution**:
   - `$(COMMAND)` or `` `COMMAND` ``: Replace with the output of `COMMAND`.

5. **Arithmetic Expansion**:
   - `$((EXPRESSION))`: Evaluate the arithmetic expression and replace it with its result.

6. **Array Expansion** (in shells like bash):
   - `${ARRAY[@]}` or `${ARRAY[*]}`: Expand to the values of the array.
   - `${#ARRAY[@]}`: Expand to the length of the array.
   
7. **String Manipulation** (in shells like bash):
   - `${VAR:offset:length}`: Substring expansion.
   - `${VAR#pattern}`: Remove matching prefix pattern.
   - `${VAR##pattern}`: Remove longest matching prefix pattern.
   - `${VAR%pattern}`: Remove matching suffix pattern.
   - `${VAR%%pattern}`: Remove longest matching suffix pattern.
   ... and other string manipulations.

8. **Default Values**:
   - `${VAR:-default}`: Use `default` if `VAR` is unset or null.
   - `${VAR:=default}`: Assign `default` to `VAR` if `VAR` is unset or null and then use `default`.
