/*
1. Start the echo command implementation.

2. Initialize a flag to track if the '-n' option is used.
   - Set the flag to false initially.

3. Check if the first argument after "echo" is '-n'.
   - If yes, set the '-n' flag to true.
   - Skip this argument for the rest of the processing.

4. Loop through each argument provided to the echo command (starting from the first argument or the second if '-n' was found):
   - Print the argument to standard output.
   - If there are more arguments:
       - Print a space after the current argument to separate from the next one.

5. After all arguments are processed:
   - If the '-n' flag is not set:
       - Print a newline character to end the output.

6. End of echo command implementation.
