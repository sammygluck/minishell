1. the file after the redirect symbol is the one to use
2. if  you have a redirect and a pipe, the redirect takes precedence
3. with multiple redirects on the same command, the last one is going to be the one used
    but the first one's file is still going to be created
4. in this case: ls | > outfile
    outfile is created but empty
5. in this case: cat > out |
    it returns a weird type of prompt
6. no input returns an error:
    bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
7. in this case: | command  
    bash: syntax error near unexpected token `|'
8. in this case: command > > outfile
    bash: syntax error near unexpected token `>'
9. in this case: command | | command2/outfile
    bash: syntax error near unexpected token `>'
10. in this case: command1 | command2 | | command3 (or any other bash syntax error)
    even earlier commands aren't executed, so both 1 and 2 aren't executed
11. in this case: command ">" outfile
    ">" get treated as an argument and not as a redirect
12. in this case: command ||| command2
    the error is only displayed once

check multiple commands with no permission input, output
